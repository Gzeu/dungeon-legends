# Legacy Files Backup

This directory contains the original HTML/JS/CSS implementation of Dungeon Legends.

These files were moved here during the migration to Next.js architecture.

## Contents

- `js/` - Original JavaScript game engine and logic
- `css/` - Original CSS styling
- `index.html` and `landing.html` - Original HTML pages

## Status

These files are kept for reference but are no longer used in the current Next.js implementation.
The game logic has been migrated to:
- `app/` - Next.js pages and components  
- `lib/` - Server-side game engine
- `styles/` - Modern CSS modules

Created: October 25, 2025
Reason: Cleanup redundant files while preserving original implementation
